ONON HALP
your last commit messed something up, now I can't pull or clone...
the problem seems to be with the build/classes/```<error>``` directory, that's what my git client is choking on
Please do another commit, so I pull again and have a look at our glorious new code

On second thought, it seems sini's gotten way ahead of us once again, so at this point we may just want to commit
his code here and work from that.  Idk what sini's working on, but I'm pretty sure his current version doesn't do
applet stuff yet, so maybe we can work on that or something.
